    BDD_PythonMySQL is a school project program proposing substitute for many food item.
    It uses Python3 and expecially Json, Requests and mysql.connector modules (Read settings section for more informations)
	This program interacts with Openfoodfact's API to implement datas in a MySQL database called "Pur_Beurre". 
    

    BDD_PythonMySQL aim to propose the user three options:
		-See a food substitute for a picking food item.
		-See previous researches.
	With the first option the user have	to pick  a food item among a large offer, stocked in the table Food of
	"Pur_Beurre" database. A substitute with a better nutriscore is returned with its name, category, nutriscore, short description,
	store for buying it and link to OpenfoodFacts web site.
    The research can at least be saved in the history table of "Pur_Beurre" database. 
	
	With second option the user choose to display the last saved research or all of them, wich are stocked in
	the table "history" of "Pur_Beurre" database.
	
	A third option is available for development of this program. It allowed to interact directly with MySQL.
